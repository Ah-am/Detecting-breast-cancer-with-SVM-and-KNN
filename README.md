# Detecting-breast-cancer-with-SVM-and-KNN
## An ML-powered system for early breast cancer detection using clinical data.

### The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used in this project to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning models. To identify cancer accurately, the data is preprocessed, divided into training/testing sets, and assessed using algorithms such as KNN and SVM.
